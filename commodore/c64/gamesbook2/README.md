### Dumper
The UFO bombs are attacking the city's barricade! How can you stop the defense-wall being smashed? You must replace the bricks in the barricade as they are knocked out by the alien forces - but will you have time?

Can you fill in the holes faster than new ones are made? Points are gained by filling in the holes - the deeper the hole, the greater the number of points you score.

> '`Z`' moves your truck left, '`C`' moves it right and '`spacebar`' drops a brick.

You have only 3 trucks left with which to defend your city - so good
luck!

### Mind Quiz
The computer will generate a sequence of four random coloured beads which you must guess. You will get eight tries. After each try, the computer will respond with a coloured bead to indicate either a right colour in the correct place or a right colour in the wrong place. By a process of elimination you should be able to guess the correct colour code combination, eventually.

### Teasure Hunt
Move the little man round the maze collecting the dollars as you go along but keep moving quickly. If you stay still for too long a killer duck will eat the little man so beware. The more dollars you collect, the higher your score.

### Stepping Stones
Move to and from on the magic floating stepping stones. Step off the stone and you will sink like a rock. You can take respite on each bank or the island in the centre of the river, but the longer you wait, the less score you make. You can move up and down or sideways from one stepping stone to another but not  diagonally.

### Plane Chase
You are the pilot of a jet fighter. Immediately in front of you is a sequence of planes moving across your missile sight. 

> The missile sight can only be moved up and down by pressing the '`Q`' and '`Z`' keys. Hitting the '`spacebar'` will fire one of these lethal projectiles. 

Beware. it takes time for the missile to get to its target. Each hit on the plane will result in a score of a hundred points. It is quite difficult to hit a plane so be exacting with shots. 

In each game a player will be given fifteen planes to shoot down with one missile per plane. The more planes you shoot down with fewer missiles the better your points per shot ratio.

### Minotaur
Move the cursor to the exit (white), using smallest possible numbers. If numbers used are too large, the mintaur ('M') moves one step closer.

Our object is to determine an integer between 0 and 1000: 'X' squares provide clues: '?' squares have random values and '*' may improve your total score. The smallest total scores are the better ones. 

>Hit '`T`' if trapped.

### Spy Training
You are at the centre of the screen and the aim is to shoot as many spies as you can in the allotted time. Your colour changes randomly and if you hit a spy of the same colour, you lose 15(1) points and you won't get an extra round.

Otherwide scoring is 5(1) points per spy hit.

CONTROLS '`Q`', '`Z`': up, down '`I`', '`P`': fire left, right

### Dragster 64
Drive the dragster down a narrow winding road. Do not crash into the armco railing and beware of spin outs off the oil slicks. Steer with the keyboard or a joystick in Port 2. Try to go as far as you can before crashing.

### Astral Attack
For this game you must guide your ship through space, avoiding planets (blue) and hitting asteroids (yellow to red). If a red asteroid misses your ship, then the game is over.

> CONTROLS '`I`' - left '`P`' - right

### Stuntman
Send the stuntman from the plane, attempting to land him on red square on trampoline. Look out for the picket fence and the telephone poles! Three misses puts a stuntman out of action but you get 3 men. 

> Use '`space bar`' to kick man out of plane.

### Convoy
You are floating on an underground river and must blow up portions of the road above in order to drop the black trucks into the river. The red trucks must not fall into the river and the black trucks must not escape at the left side of the screen.

By pressing the '`space bar`', you either deposit a bomb or patch up the road, depending on your position. The seconds left for the fuse are at bottom left of screen.

> CONTROLS '`I`', '`P`' : left, right

### Egg Plant
The objective of this game is to destroy the egg creature. He is protected by a moving fence with gaps in it and a shield. You must fire your missiles up at the creature through the fence and gradually eat the shield away.

When there is a complete hole in the fence you can destroy the egg creature. Beware, he can drop bombs on you which can be avoided by moving the missile launcher from side to side with the I and P keys. The missile launcher only has a limited number of missiles, thirty, and a small amount of fuel with which to move itself. Each time that you eat a chunk out of the shield you get 20 points. Hitting the Egg Plant gives 100 points.

### Tank Ambush
Lob bombs from your tank on the cliff onto the enemy tanks in the dark.

> Hit '`space`' for a flare or key in angle of elevation and shell (muzzle
velocity) followed by '`space`' to send a bomb.

### Brick Buster
Blast your way through brick wall by moving your bat. The bat becomes shorter if you manage to get through.

> LEFT: '`I`' RIGHT: '`P`'

### Alligator
Move the alligator to right side of screen, ensuring that all yellow fish have been eaten. Beware of the black mines which explode if eaten, and watch the air guage in case alligator drowns (i.e. surface for air).

Must also beat overall time limit in order to get to a new round.

Scoring: 
- exotic fish (red) 20
- yellow fish 150
- plants 10

> Controls : UP - '`Q`', DOWN - '`Z`', RIGHT - '`P`'

### Road Patrol
During the year 2033 there was high UFO activity and thus all patrol cars were fitted with laser guns, however the laser beams were as yet unable to penetrate the UFO force field.

Unfortunately, earth had not developed a force field which was permanent and every 20 hits from a laser ray dissipated some of the force field energy which could only withstand 100 direct hits.

As Commander of patrol car C64 it is your duty to patrol a desert road where there have been sightings of a UFO. It is your duty to fire rapidly at the UFO to try and break the force field even though it is believed impossible.

### Snake Pit
Pit two snakes against each other to make one bite the other's tail.

You can play an opponent or the computer, using the keyboard or joysticks. Do not run into the wall, do not bite your own tail orturn back on yourself. You must try and block the other snake's path so he runs into your tail.

Seven bites of the tail determines the winner of each game. Do not hold keys down or the joystick in a fixed position; the snake will run in one direction until a new direction given.

### Detonator
Position the space ship within firing range of the hollowed sections of the three mountains and detonate the small bombs in these sections. The idea is to drop the bomb sitting on top of each mountain as far as possible into the mountain in order to blow it up.

However, if you touch any of the mountains, you blow up and the game is over. Engine malfunctions become more common as game proceeds.

> CONTROLS : '`O`' = Up,'`Z`' = Down, '`I`' = Left, '`P`' = Right, '`space bar`'= fire

### Letter Box
Catch the falling letters and post them in the letter box on the left. If you do not catch them they will go into the dead letter box on the right. If you fill the good letter box before the dead letter box then you will proceed to the next of the five floors. However, should the dead letter box be filled first then you will go back to the previous floor. The letters fall faster for each higher floor.

The mailman can be moved left and right with the left and right cursor keys prior to the letter falling. When the letter is falling the mailman can only be moved right by pressing the key that matches the letter that is falling. To move the mailman left, use the same key simultaneously with the shift key.

The game can be finished at any time by pressing the function 7 (seven) key.

### Crash Barrier
Test your skiill as a high speed driver. Race around the track swapping lanes whenever you feel like it. 

> Use the '`A`', '`W`', '`D`' & '`Z`' keys to steer and press the '`X`' key to swap speeds - High speed to low speed and low speed to high speed.

Your car is red at low speed and green at high speed.

You will gain more points by keeping the keys depressed and you get higher points for high speed.

Do not crash into the walls and beware of the crash barriers that appear suddenly in front of you. You have 8 cars to demolish!

### Laser Battle
Defend three nuclear reactors by zapping aliens with your laser. The aliens must first destroy part of your bunker before they can shoot behind it.

> CONTROLS : '`I`' = Left, '`P`' = Right, '`space`' = fire

### Attack Of The Vogons
Escape from Vogan territory and avoid collisions. When your ship is yellow (achieved by pressing '`space bar`') it can withstand a collision. 

Game ends when you collide while not being 'armed' for collision.

### Interceptor
The task is to prevent the alien ships from landing. To fire, select horizontal and vertical co-ordinates (both 0-99) and then press the space bar.

The game end a if the aliens land or if you run out of energy.

Scoring: mother ship is 100 points, other ships 50 points.

### Breakin
In this game you score 1 point for each brick you knock out of the wall. A bonus is awarded at the start of each game and every multiple of 100 points gained refreshes the brick wall. You are given 9 balls for each game and you lose a ball each time it gets past your bat. 

>The bat can be moved left and right with the '`Z`' and '`M`' keys.

There are 3 different game versions and two bat sizes for your own selection. Selecting Bat 2 gives 200 bonus points. Selecting Bat 3 gives 100 bonus points.

### Tanc
This game is a two player tank game. You need two joysticks to play.

Each player has 3 tanks. If a tank is hit 3 times it is destroyed. Avoid the mud because it slows down your progress.

### Clucky Chook
A clucky chook has escaped from the hen house and has gone on an egg laying spree. After plugging your joystick into port 2 you must control the pan at the bottom of the screen. Catch the eggs before they fall and break. The  incorporation of 'Sprite Move' makes this game both fast and addictive.

### Soldier
The game begins with you as a Soldier within the safety of your tank.

While you reside within the tank you are protected against the continuous barrage of enemy missiles. The objective is to leave the tank and weave your way through the mine field while dodging enemy missile explosions, and make your way to the ammunition dump behind the enemy missile launchers. Carry a single missile back through the mine field to your tank and attempt to destroy one of the enemy missile launchers. Continue this manoeuvre until all of the launchers have been
destroyed. 

> This game is joystick controlled.
