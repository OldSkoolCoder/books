### Paranoid
Just sit back and watch the machine print a kaleidoscope of graphics patterns. When you've had enough just 'stop' the program. For an entirely different pattern re-run the program.

This is an easy, short program that has pretty impressive results. Use it in understanding your machine's graphics capabilities or just something to occupy your screen (and spectators) while you are doing something else.
 
### Poetry
Sit back and watch as the program writes poetry before your very eyes.
Try making changes to the poem's words to make it ridiculous or humourous or just try and give it more to write.

>Press'N' key to stop the program or any other key for another poem.

### Turkey
Attempt to keep the turkey in the air as long as possible by manoeuvering the waiter underneath it and then bouncing it off the platter.

>You control the waiter with the '`Z`' (left) and '`M`' (right) keys. The turkey can be dropped twice but becomes inedible after the third time and the game ends.

### Quack
This is the old fair ground game but instead of using bullets you are equipped with a bow and arrow. An arrow will of course travel slower than a bullet and thus requires better anticipation. 

The ducks do not move at a uniform speed which makes the game a lot harder. You have a limited number of arrows and also a time limit.

>Your controls are: '`Z`' left '`C`' right '`M`' to `fire` an arrow

### Laser Tower
Escape from the Laser Tower, battling against gravity and evading the tractor beam. The tractor beam fires from the tower on the left of the screen. It alters its height as you move away from it, trying to land in the pit at the right.

>Your controls are: cursor up for up, cursor right for right.

### Moon Buggy
Manoeuvre your jumping moon buggy over the moon's surface attempting to reach the landing pad on the other side without running out of fuel or crashing into a star mine.

The moon buggy needs to build up thrust but be careful because once "lift-off' has occurred it has a lot of forward momentum. The star mines are everywhere in space and you have to manoeuvre between them to get to the landing pad.

>Your controls are: '`Z`' left '`C`' right '`M`' thrust

### Higher Or Lower
Bet on the card being higher or lower than the previous one. If you win, you may get the chance to go for double or nothing. 

The routines used to draw cards and select them from the deck are good. They would be useful in creating programs for your own card games. All instructions necessary for the game are in the program.

### North Sea Copter
This game really tests your skill and though it might seem otherwise it is possible to complete it.

You must land your copter on an oil rig, at night, in the height of a storm, visibility is nil and you rely on lightning to see the rig. The wind buffets you about and as you manoeuvre or hover, gravity will pull you down, you must correct this by increasing lift.

On the right of your screen are your instruments, watch your fuel and rate of descent, to land your rate must be below 2.

>'`A`' moves you to the left, '`D`' to the right and '`W`' gives you lift.

### Filght Simulator
Test your skill at guiding your light aircraft onto the landing strip. 

Can you make a perfect landing? Watch your instruments as the runway comes up into view, you get all the feedback you need to do the job.

>Your controls are:
>- '`F1`' gives a cockpit display
>- '`F3`' gives a map
>- '`A`' tilts the plane to the left
>- '`D`' tilts it to the right
>- '`W`' alters levelling up
>- '`X`' alters levelling down
>- Keys 1 - 9 decide your acceleration/deceleration
>- '`-`' reverses the acceleration/deceleration rate
>- '`space bar`' lifts or lowers your undercarriage

There are many ways in which to 'fail' your landing:
- if the plane is tilted on an angle
- if the last altitude reading was above 50 (you've dropped the plane)
- if your attitude is not level
- if your undercarriage is not lowered

Safe landing!

### Slalom
Can you complete the slope? If you can, how many points can you get? You gain points for passing through the posts and crash if you hit a tree or an ice crack.
Watch the skier jump for joy if he completes the course or end up, upside-down in the snow if he trips on a tree!

>Your controls are: '`Z`' tilts the skis left '`M`' tilts the skis right

>** NOTE : Movement continues in the chosen direction until changed! **

### Fruit Machine
A version of the old favourite. It costs you £10 a go and you can win up to £100. Pull the handle and try your luck! 

The program contains some nice graphics. 
>All instructions are included.

### Sea Harrier
This is an exciting up-to-date warfare game!

You are the pilot of a carrier-based aircraft and your mission is to destroy an invading submarine using depth charges. The enemy submarine must be destroyed in one minute, by dropping a depth charge on him, or he will escape to attack your country. When dropping your charges you must be careful not to detonate a nuclear
mine placed by your own forces! The submarine will change depth and speed trying to avoid your assault.

On the right is you fuel gauge, if it reaches the top you have run out of fuel and will crash. To prevent this you can return to your carrier to replenish your fuel and launch another attack on the sub. Be careful to land gently and not crash.

>Your controls are: '`Z`' to move up '`C`' to move down '`<`' to go left '`>`' to go right '`space bar`' to drop depth charge

### Cats And Dogs
It's raining cats and dogs! You have to catch suicidal cats and dogs but if you don't they die. For every third miss, a cross will appear, but you are only allowed three crosses.

>Controls are: '`Z`' to move your animal lover to the left and '`M`' to move
him/her right.

### Horse Racing
Bet on the horses without losing anything. The game begins with the names of the four horses displayed against their odds. You must choose a horse and place your bet.

>Program contains full instructions.

### Luna Lander
This is one for all you budding young astronauts. The surface of the moon is looming closer, and you must control the horizontal and vertical velocities of your module to achieve a feather-light landing.

Keep an eye on your fuel gauge at the bottom of the screen, don't run out of fuel. The more difficult the landing site the more points you get for a successful mission, each perfect landing increases the difficulty of the next. Be careful not to damage your module by landing too hard.

>Controls are: '`C`' move right '`Z`' move left '`F3`' 1/4 power thrust '`F5`' 1/2 power thrust '`F7`' full power thrust

### Simon
Simon plays a series of tones incrementing the number each time. You must repeat the sequence. The screen displays the numbers 1 - 6 and one of these will light up to correspond with the tones played. Each time Simon repeats a sequence he adds a note and plays the 'tune' faster.

You win by repeating his tune until it is eight notes long. Use the keys 1 - 6 to reproduce the tones and lights.

> Remember, this game tests your speed as well as your memory and you only have a limited amount of time to react!

### Racer
This is a Grand Prix simulation with a different twist. You have anticipated your win and celebrated before the race. as a result you are drunk and end up driving the race in the wrong direction.

>Instructions are contained within the program which allows you to select different levels of speed and skill. 

Watch out for oil slicks!

### Cosmic Bugs
In this game creatures attempt to get from the top of the screen to the bottom where they turn into Crabs which close in on you.

You defend yourself with a blaster that can fire nets or energy blasts. Nets trap the creatures and earn you double points, energy blasts kill them but sometimes only split them in which case you only get half points. If the screen turns yellow you must prepare to move your blaster as it moves up the screen to the top, once successfully at the top the game will resume in a new play area.

The creatures are:
- Scorpions - These are red and worth 10 points for a kill.
- Spikers - These are green and worth 20 points, or 30 when they leave a spike behind.
 - Cutters - These are blue and can free other creatures from nets. They are worth 40 points and cannot be netted themselves.
- Crabs - These are other creatures who have reached the bottom.

Your only method of killing them is to use the super-zapper, (space bar) this uses 25 points. The screen is grey when you have enough points. The first time it is used it kills all life, otherwise only crabs.

>Controls: '`Z`' blaster left '`C`' blaster right '`>`' fire nets '`<`' fire energy blaster '`space bar`' super-zapper

### Star Duel
Ram challenges you to a dog fight. The game begins when you accept the challenge.

You must avoid the ground, his craft and his missiles while trying to manoeuvre your craft into a position which will enable you to fire your missiles at him.

>Your craft is controlled by using the '`W`' and '`X`' keys to move up and down, and the '`A`' and '`D`' keys to shift left and right. When you have Ram in your sights use the '`S`' key to fire your missile.

#### Remember, if either craft is hit it will crash to the ground.

Yours is the blue craft. See if you can outsmart him!

### Cowboy Shoot Out 
Shoot the computer-controlled cowboy as many times as you can without him shooting you. As you shoot it out you have to avoid the wagons passing between you. You can't shoot through them.

>Your controls are: '`W`' forup '`X`' fordown '`S`' to fire 

You're on the left, the computer is on the right. Straight shooting!

### Earth Defense
You are left with insufficient fuel to make it back to earth so you embark on a suicide mission to kill as many aliens as possible with your remaining fuel.

> Your controls are: '`W`' up '`X`' down '`A`' left 'D' right '`S`' to fire '`space bar`' for shields.

You have shields to protect your spaceship, however these use a lot of
fuel and only last for a couple of seconds.

> While shielded your craft will be a grey colour.

### Jelly Maze
How may points can you get before the jelly creature kills you? 

There are 5 Power Pills in the maze, eat one of these and you will turn blue. When you are blue you can eat the jelly creature, but be careful you will not remain blue for longer than a few seconds.

You gain 1 point for moving, 100 points for eating a Power Pill and 500 points for eating a jelly creature. If you eat one, another will apear.

>Your controls are: '`W`' up '`X`' down '`A`' left '`D`' right

### Dark Star
Test your skills against the enemy and the clock!

The Death Star will obliterate your home planet, when it comes into range from behind its moon, using the immense power of its space gun. Before this happens you will attempt to take as many attacking enemy fighters with you before you are shot down or they shoot your home planet.

> You fly your X wing fighter along the trench on the Death Star engaging the enemy in mortal combat, using the '`Z`' and '`C`' keys to move left and right and '`M`' to fire.

Straight Shooting!

### Tank Attack
The aliens are coming again!

Controlling a laser tank, you must try and stop as many starships as possible from landing. If one does land it will release the aliens and fly away.

The starships are protected by a force-field which flickers on and off.

When blue the craft can be destroyed, when red the force-field protects the ship. The starships will attempt to destroy you using guided lasers.

> Your controls are: '`Z`' to move the tank left '`C`' to move the tank right '`M`' to fire your laser

### Star Pilot
This program also contains some machine code routines.

In this game you, the Star Pilot, must attempt to get approaching and retreating enemy space craft into your sights and blast them.

The game's objective is to get as many enemy craft as possible within the 2 minutes playing time allowed.

> '`W`' and '`X`' control your up and down movement.
> '`A`' and '`D`' control your left and right

### Martian Invasion
Fly your plane over the city, watching Martian Pods drop from the sky.

A tripod or a flying machine will hatch out from the crater left by the Pod.
The tripods shoot at you and the flying machine will try to crash into you.
All this while a red weed starts growing and crawling.
You must shoot as many Martians as possible before your inevitable defeat. If you crash into a pod you explode, so avoid them. This game has excellent graphics and should provide many hours of fun.

> Your controls are: '`W`' up '`X`' down '`A`' left '`D`' right '`S`' to fire your laser

See how many you can get!

### Castle Of Doom
Explore the rooms within the castle walls, look for treasure and try to avoid the slime monsters and killer robots.

Points are gained by moving over question marks and killing monsters or robots with your Proton gun.

As you move off the screen from one room you are presented with another. Move back and you return to the same room but now with different contents!

You are killed if you touch the electrified walls or any of the monsters. Some monsters are faster than others and the robots are very dangerous.

> Controls are: '`W`' up '`D`' right '`X`' down '`A`' left '`S`' to fire your gun

### U.F.O.
Another U.F.O. game with aliens attacking your craft. This one however contains a Machine Code routine to scroll the screen.

Shoot down the attacking U.F.O.'s with one of your missiles. The game ends if you crash or if a U.F.O. gets past you.

> Your controls are: '`W`' up '`X`' down '`S`' to fire

### Galaxy Raid
A fleet of aliens looms above you, one by one they dive to attack you with their guided missiles.

You must avoid their missiles and destroy the alien ships. The main group is protected by a force field and only diving craft are vulnerable to your counter-fire. If you destroy the fleet another appears to replace it.

> Your controls are: '`Z`' for left '`C`' for right '`M`' to fire a missile

### Invaders
Battle the invaders with your base on the ground. The arcade classic should have you addicted in no time at all.

> Controls are: '`Z`' left, '`C`' right and '`M`' to fire.

This program contains a large amount of machine code to control the invaders. Even if you don't as yet fully understand what is being done, don't worry. Just key the lines in carefully - especially the data lines.

Check them thoroughly before trying to play the game.
